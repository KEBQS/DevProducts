This is a Shiny application built for Coursera Data Science Developing Data Products Course to visualize data from Colorado Department of Revenue website.  
 <https://www.colorado.gov/revenue>.  
 
To download the data you will need to go to <https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/revenue/retail-sales-report> and 
choose one of the options in the selection criteria to download the excel file(s). One file per month.  

I downloaded each excel file from 2010 to 2015, (72 excel files), and compiled them using R into one csv file, that is the one I am attaching in this project.  
  
The dataset consists of 154,440 rows with Retail Sales information for all Colorado Counties by Industry.
